USER GUIDE FOR NEW FEATURES:

Endorse Feature:
- To use the endorse you must be logged in as an admin user
- Once logged in as an admin go to a topic and find a post
- On the post click on the upvote button
- Refresh the page and there will be a message next to the timestamp stating 
  that the post has been endorsed by an instructor and there will also be a 
  message when you click on the number of people who voted stating the same
  message
- Removing the upvote and refreshing the page will cause these messages to 
  disappear
- To user test this feature you can try logging in as non-admin users and 
  upvote posts to ensure that the endorsement message is not displayed after
  upovting.  Then login as an admin and upvote the post to ensure it works 
  for admins.  Also try removing the upvote as an admin to make sure the 
  message goes away.  Note that the page must be refreshed after the upvote
  action in order to see changes.
